This is some little hack to make Emacs command [[https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/][Nyxt]]. In particular
this provides a function to browse URLs via Nyxt run via Slime.

The dependencies are:

- Slime
- Nyxt ([[https://ag91.github.io/blog/2021/05/30/browsing-in-common-lisp-nyxt-and-emacs][ideally installed via Guix if you are on Linux]])


You can find here the blogs that explain in more detail how this works:

Please follow the instructions here: https://github.com/deddu/nyxt-docker

Then set =(setq shell-command-switch "-ic")= and add to your =.zshrc= file (substitute your user for =<your-user>=)

#+begin_src sh :noeval
alias nyxt="xterm -e 'xhost +127.0.0.1; docker run -it -p 4006:4006 -v /Users/<your-user>:/root/ --rm bigdeddu/nyxt:2.2.1'"
#+end_src

After that you should have everything to run =emacs-with-nyxt=. [[https://github.com/deddu/nyxt-docker/issues/6][And make sure Swank or Sly use 0.0.0.0 instead of localhost]].
