This is some little hack to make Emacs command [[https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/][Nyxt]]. In particular
this provides a function to browse URLs via Nyxt run via Slime.

The dependencies are:

- Slime
- Nyxt ([[https://ag91.github.io/blog/2021/05/30/browsing-in-common-lisp-nyxt-and-emacs][ideally installed via Guix if you are on Linux]])


You can find here the blog that explains in detail how this works:
